# 🦠 ISYE6644 Advanced Pandemic Flu Spread Project

This project simulates the spread of an influenza pandemic and evaluates intervention strategies to control its impact. Using a simulation-based approach, the model analyzes both **non-pharmaceutical** and **pharmaceutical interventions**—such as vaccination and social distancing—to guide effective pandemic response planning.

Developed by: Joel Zhu Hui Quek, Wei Sin Ho, and Zehao Chen.

## 📌 Project Overview

Titled *"Optimizing Non-Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Interventions to Mitigate Influenza Pandemic Spread"*, this project models how an infectious disease spreads in a hypothetical population under various containment strategies. The goal is to simulate real-world pandemic dynamics and provide insights into how interventions can reduce transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths.

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. How does a pandemic spread in the absence of interventions?
2. What is the comparative effectiveness of vaccination versus social distancing?
3. Can a combined intervention strategy outperform individual approaches in reducing disease spread?

## 🧬 Simulation Model

The simulation mimics daily interactions among individuals in a population, tracking infection, recovery, and mortality using probabilistic methods.

**Key Model Components**:
- **Infection Dynamics**: Simulates interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals.
- **Status Updates**: Stochastic modeling of recoveries and fatalities each day.
- **Vaccination Strategy**: Applies daily vaccinations to reduce susceptible population and simulate immunity build-up.
- **Intervention Scenarios**: Compares outcomes across different strategies—no intervention, vaccination only, distancing only, and combined approaches.
