# ISYE6644 Advanced Pandemic Flu Spread Project

## Project Overview
This project titled "Optimizing Non-Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Interventions to Mitigate Influenza Pandemic
Spread: A Simulation-Based Approach", conducted by Joel Zhu Hui Quek, Wei Sin Ho, and Zehao Chen, focuses on optimizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate influenza pandemic spread through a simulation-based approach. The simulation models the spread of an infectious disease within a large population under various intervention strategies, providing insights into the effectiveness of these interventions in controlling the disease spread.


## Repository Structure
Contains all source code files for the simulation.


## Simulation Model
The model simulates the spread of an infectious disease within a hypothetical population to understand the dynamics of transmission without interventions and evaluates various intervention strategies such as vaccination and social distancing.

### Key Components
- **Calculating New Infections**: Simulates daily interactions between infectious and susceptible individuals.
- **Updating Status**: Uses a stochastic approach to determine daily recoveries and deaths.
- **Applying Vaccination**: Implements daily vaccinations, adjusting the susceptible and vaccinated populations accordingly.

## Installation
To set up the simulation environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/datakunoichi
cd ISYE6644
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the simulation:
```bash
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the desired scripts from the scripts folder to process the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and train machine learning models.
4. Execute run.sh to automate the entire pipeline.
```
